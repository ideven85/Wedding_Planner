					<h3 class="text-heading title_color">Best Neighborhoods to stay</h3>
					<p class="sample-text">
						Buenos Aires is a VERY big city, and choosing the best place to stay can be complicated. As always, the final decision is yours, we just want to give you our own opinion.
					</p>
                    <p class="sample-text">
                        <b>Palermo:</b> is a very trendy neighborhood, lots of restaurants boutiques, parks, etc. Plus, we are going to organize transportation to and from the wedding venue <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7CiQctmj8tSomxUm8">from here</a> (Aquiles' parent's house). It is very well connected with several subways, trains and buses that run all day/night. Therefore, it is always a good starting point for your visit to the city. <br />Palermo is also a big neighborhood. As a general rule of thumb, if you stay close to Av. Santa Fe, you'll have plenty of access to transportation. If you want to have an active nightlife, restaurants, cafés and chic boutiques close-by you can check the sub-neighborhood called <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Palermo+Soho/@-34.5899744,-58.4278081,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x95bcb5877e9389c9:0xd26f9ca22f5f2c00!8m2!3d-34.5899744!4d-58.4256141">Palermo-Soho</a> (just see how many restaurant labels appear on the map!).<br />
                        To find a hotel, you can check <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html?label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaKkBiAEBmAEJuAEZyAEP2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALavvnnBcACAQ&sid=68cd552fa630b441c273b25c218d348d&tmpl=searchresults&ac_click_type=b&ac_position=0&class_interval=1&dest_id=-979186&dest_type=city&dtdisc=0&from_sf=1&group_adults=2&group_children=0&iata=BUE&inac=0&index_postcard=0&label_click=undef&no_rooms=1&postcard=0&raw_dest_type=city&room1=A%2CA&sb_price_type=total&search_selected=1&shw_aparth=1&slp_r_match=0&src=index&srpvid=e56260fdd29101c3&ss=Buenos%20Aires%2C%20Argentina&ss_all=0&ss_raw=Buenos%20Aires&ssb=empty&sshis=0&ssne=Vienna&ssne_untouched=Vienna&nflt=di%3D1736%3B&rsf=">on Booking.com</a> to see some of the offers in the neighborhood. Another option is to use <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/c/acarattino?currency=EUR">AirBnb</a>. If you use the link, you will get €25 discount on your stay!<br />
                        The only downside of Palermo is that it can get a bit more expensive than other areas. Overall, most tourists who stay in this area never regret it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sample-text"><b>San Telmo:</b> is the <i>historical</i> center of the city, but don't expect it to be European-style historical. This neighborhood was evacuated because of a yellow fiver epidemic in the XIX century, and only in recent decades started to regain relevance between locals and foreigners. If you are into Tango, learning Spanish, being in the core of the touristic spots, this is your place to be. It is easy to find hostels and hotels alike. <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaKkBiAEBmAEJuAEZyAEP2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALavvnnBcACAQ&sid=68cd552fa630b441c273b25c218d348d&tmpl=searchresults&ac_click_type=b&ac_position=0&class_interval=1&dest_id=-979186&dest_type=city&dtdisc=0&from_sf=1&group_adults=2&group_children=0&iata=BUE&inac=0&index_postcard=0&label_click=undef&no_rooms=1&postcard=0&raw_dest_type=city&room1=A%2CA&sb_price_type=total&search_selected=1&shw_aparth=1&slp_r_match=0&src=index&srpvid=3bf262ceaa4a003d&ss=Buenos%20Aires%2C%20Argentina&ss_all=0&ss_raw=Buenos%20Aires&ssb=empty&sshis=0&ssne=Vienna&ssne_untouched=Vienna&nflt=di%3D1854%3B&rsf=">Booking</a> has a good selection of options.<br />
                        The downside of San Telmo is that in the evenings can get a bit more desolated than other neighborhoods. You still have decent access to transportation and nightly activities. If you are in doubt, let us know and we can orient you.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sample-text"><b>Recoleta:</b> This neighborhood is in between Palermo and the city-center. It is well located for city exploring, but most likely you will find yourself elsewhere enjoying what the city has to offer. Good access to transportation, our recommendation is that the closer you stay to Av. Las Heras the nicer it is.</p>
                    <p class="sample-text"><b>Belgrano:</b> Next to Palermo, but in the opposite direction from the city center, Belgrano used to have a decent selection of <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/c/acarattino?currency=EUR">AirBnb</a> apartments. While the neighborhood is nice for a local, as a tourist you will find yourself going elsewhere to enjoy the evenings and sightseeing. Belgrano is a good option if you find a cheaper place than in Palermo, or if you are not going to spend plenty of time in the city.</p>
                    <p class="sample-text"><b>Other options</b>: With the neighborhoods above, we have covered a big area of the touristic parts of the city. If you are looking for other alternatives, that may have a bit more of a local flavor without sacrificing location, you may check <i>Almagro</i>, <i>Villa Crespo</i> or <i>Caballito</i>. These are much less traditional neighborhoods for tourists but are still relatively well located to enjoy the city. Just let us know if you are in doubt.</p>
